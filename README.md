#TASK DESCRIPTION

In this task I have designed a Digital FIR(Finite Impulse Response) Filter using Verilog-HDL. FIR Filter is a widely used filter known for its stability. It utilises a finite number of input samples and after the final output turns zero. Common applications of FIR filter are image processing, noise reduction and communication systems.It is based on the principle of convoluting the input samples with filter's coefficients.
